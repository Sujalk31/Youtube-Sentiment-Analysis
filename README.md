# Youtube-Sentiment-Analysis
This Flask web application retrieves and analyzes YouTube video comments, performing sentiment analysis on each comment. The app uses the VADER Sentiment Analysis library to classify comments as positive, neutral, or negative based on their text. It fetches comments using the YouTube Data API and allows the user to specify a YouTube video ID and the number of comments to analyze. The sentiment of the comments is displayed on a results page, and a pie chart visualizing the sentiment distribution is generated and displayed. The application also includes separate pages for the home, about, and input sections. This project demonstrates integrating sentiment analysis with YouTube data and Flask for building a simple web interface.
